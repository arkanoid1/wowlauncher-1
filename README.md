Launcher for World of Warcraft private servers

Features:
-Patch downloader
-Clear Cache
-Launch Game
-Set Realmlist
-Select Directory

Coming Soon:
-Account Creation Via Application
-News loaded from database table
-Will be skinned, but likely the last thing I do as the UI is constantly changing.

Feel free to distribute or reuse code, this was a learning project for myself. Glad to help anyone that needs it.
